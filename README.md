# merkle-tree-exploration

This repository serves two purposes:
1) Challenging myself to build a Merkle tree implementation from the ground-up, building a better understanding of the blockchain
2) Testing my technical ability in Rust (I love Rust!)

I currently have a working implementation of Merkle tree creation, as well as an inclusion proof (for a single element) and an update element function, along with requisite verification+test methods. Next steps include building an inclusion proof for a contiguous set of elements.
